# Philosopher's Stone

This project allows a user to input any phrase or sentence, choose a word in the sentence to change, and lastly the word they want it changed too. This will allow you to take any sentence and turn it into gold.

## Usage

```
philosophers-stone.html
```

once on the webpage all you need to do is fill out the form for the phrase, the word to change in the phrase, and the word to change it to. Once you click transform you will see your new sentence made of gold.
